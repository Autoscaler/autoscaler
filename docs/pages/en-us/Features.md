# Key Features

## Elastic Scaling
Easily scale up and down Workers based on key metrics and also allocate resources where they are needed most.  Workers can also scale up and down depending on the complexity or volume of work performed, making maximum use of the available resources.

## Extensibility
With many customers in many timezones, a single application may experience rapidly fluctuating load demands. The problem is not simply scaling up to meet the demand, but scaling back down to better optimize the use of resources. Plug-in support for monitoring workloads, scaling decisions and scaling commands allows the Autoscaler to be used in a variety of environments.

## Ready to go
Out of the box support for the Worker Framework, RabbitMQ and Marathon makes it easy to start scaling today. Autoscaler provides out of the box scaling for all your Workers!
